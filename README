== Introduction ==
PicoBlaze is a 8-bit embedded processor.
Created by Ken Chapman, work in xilinx.

And I found PicoBlaze after used of MicoBlaze.
I use PicoBlaze as SPI master for AD7715, but wrote firmware
in assembly is too hard when the source code growing up.
So I write a simple assembly preprocessor in python.

This memo is what I have done. Writing down
something as manual for myself:)
